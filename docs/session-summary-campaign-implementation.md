# Campaign Implementation Session Summary

## Overview
This session focused on implementing the Campaign resource as a join between Season and Team, along with major improvements to the seed system to handle complex sports data scenarios.

## Campaign Resource Implementation

### Core Model
- **Campaign**: Join table between Team and Season with unique index
- **Purpose**: Key to attach additional data to team-season relationships
- **Fields**: team_id, season_id, comments (array), seed_version, last_seeded_at
- **Associations**: belongs_to :team, :season; has_one :league, :sport (through associations)

### MVC Structure
- **Controller**: `CampaignsController` with index/show actions using Filterable concern
- **Views**: Simple index and show templates following existing patterns
- **Routes**: Nested under seasons and teams, plus standalone routes
- **Helper**: Basic `CampaignsHelper` module
- **Filterable**: Added to filterable associations with proper join paths

## Seed System Improvements

### 1. Modular Glob Pattern Architecture
**Problem**: Seed classes received entire hash and had to extract their specific patterns
**Solution**: Each SeedX class now receives only its specific glob array

```ruby
# Before
SeedPlayers.run(glob_patterns)  # Had to access glob_patterns[:players]

# After  
SeedPlayers.run(glob_patterns[:players])  # Direct array access
```

### 2. NFL Multi-Team File Support
**Problem**: NFL file excluded due to multiple teams per file format
**Solution**: Enhanced `SeedHelpers.load_json_files` to handle both formats:
- Single JSON object per file (existing)
- Multiple JSON objects separated by newlines (new)

### 3. Sport-Aware Team Lookup
**Problem**: Team name conflicts (Jets: NFL vs NHL, Giants: NFL vs MLB, Cardinals: NFL vs MLB)
**Solution**: Added sport context to team lookup:
```ruby
def self.find_team_by_sport_and_mascot(sport, mascot)
  Team.joins(league: :sport).find_by(
    mascot: mascot,
    sports: { name: sport.name }
  )
end
```

## Era-Based Campaign System

### Problem Statement
Need to track when teams were actually in specific leagues over time:
- Expansion teams (Austin FC joined MLS in 2021)
- League transitions (FC Cincinnati: USL â†’ MLS in 2019)
- Relegation/promotion (European soccer)

### Solution Architecture

#### Era Structure
```ruby
Era = Struct.new(:league, :start_year, :end_year) do
  def active_in_year?(year)
    year >= start_year && (end_year.nil? || year <= end_year)
  end
end
```

#### Team Decoration
Teams are decorated with `@eras` instance variables containing Era arrays during seed process.

#### JSON File Formats

**Expansions** (`sports/**/expansions.json`):
```json
{
  "league_name": "MLS",
  "expansions": [
    { "team_name": "Atlanta United FC", "year": 2017 },
    { "team_name": "Austin FC", "year": 2021 }
  ]
}
```

**Transitions** (`sports/**/transitions.json`):
```json
{
  "transitions": [
    {
      "team_name": "FC Cincinnati",
      "from_league": "USL Championship",
      "to_league": "MLS", 
      "year": 2019,
      "from_year": 2016
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Campaign Generation Logic
1. Initialize all teams with current league era (no end date = current)
2. Process expansion files to set correct start years
3. Process transition files to create proper era boundaries
4. Generate campaigns only for teams that were in a league during a season's year

### Benefits
- **Historical Accuracy**: Campaigns reflect when teams actually played in leagues
- **Flexibility**: Handles expansion, relegation, promotion, league changes
- **No Schema Changes**: Uses instance variable decoration pattern
- **Extensible**: Easy to add more complex transition scenarios

## Technical Improvements

### Seed System Modularity
- Glob patterns defined centrally but passed individually
- Each SeedX class focuses on its specific data type
- Easier to test and modify individual seed components

### Multi-Format JSON Support
- Handles both single-object and multi-object JSON files
- Graceful error handling for malformed JSON
- Supports future data format variations

### Sport Context Awareness
- Resolves team name conflicts across sports
- Enables accurate cross-sport data management
- Foundation for sport-specific logic

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Campaign Files
- `app/models/campaign.rb` - Campaign model with associations
- `app/controllers/campaigns_controller.rb` - Controller with Filterable
- `app/views/campaigns/index.html.erb` - Index view
- `app/views/campaigns/show.html.erb` - Show view  
- `app/helpers/campaigns_helper.rb` - Helper module
- `db/migrate/[timestamp]_create_campaigns.rb` - Migration with unique index

### Seed System Files
- `db/seeds.rb` - Updated to pass individual glob arrays
- `db/seeds/seed_campaigns.rb` - Era-based campaign generation
- `db/seeds/seed_players.rb` - Sport-aware team lookup
- `lib/seed_helpers.rb` - Multi-format JSON support
- All `db/seeds/seed_*.rb` files - Updated for new glob pattern architecture

### Configuration
- `config/routes.rb` - Campaign routes (nested and standalone)
- `config/initializers/filterable_associations.rb` - Campaign filterable config

### Example Data
- `db/seeds/athlete_ace_data/sports/soccer/USA/MLS/expansions.json`
- `db/seeds/athlete_ace_data/sports/soccer/USA/MLS/transitions.json`
- `db/seeds/athlete_ace_data/sports/soccer/united_kingdom/Premier_League/transitions.json`

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)
- Campaign factory and specs for testing
- Additional transition scenarios for other sports
- UI for managing era data through admin interface
- Campaign-specific data fields (performance metrics, etc.)

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Era Decoration Pattern**: Avoids database schema complexity while providing rich historical data
2. **Modular Seed Architecture**: Improves maintainability and testability
3. **Sport Context**: Enables accurate data management across multiple sports
4. **JSON-Driven Configuration**: Makes historical data easy to maintain and version control
